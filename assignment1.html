    <h2>DEFINE 10 JAVASCRIPT RESERVED KEYWORDS AND THEIR USAGE</h2> <br>
   <ol>
        <li>LET:let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used</li> <br>
        <li>VAR:This is the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable. x is the name of that variable</li><br>
        <li>CONST:The const declaration creates block-scoped constants, much like variables declared using the let keyword</li><br>
        <li>ELSE:This is to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li><br>
        <li>WHILE:This is use to creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true</li><br>
        <li>RETURN:The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller</li><br>
        <li>BREAK:The break statement terminates the current loop or switch statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement.</li><br>
        <li>CONTINUE:The continue statement terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration</li><br>
        <li>IF:IF is to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li><br>
        <li>TRY:The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed</li>
   </ol>

    <h3>(2)WRITE A SHORT STORY ON JAVASCRIPT IS A PROGRAMING LANGUAGE THAT WAS CREATED BY BRENDAN EICH IN JUST 10 DAYS IN MAY 1995</h3>
    <P>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just ten days in May 1995. At the time, Eich was working for Netscape Communications Corporation, which was one of the leading web browser companies at the time.

        Netscape had just released its new web browser, Netscape Navigator 2.0, which included support for a scripting language called LiveScript.
        
        Eich was tasked with creating a new scripting language for Navigator that would be easier to use and more powerful than LiveScript. Eich was given just ten days to create this new language, which he initially called Mocha. Eich was inspired by several other programming languages when he created Mocha, including Java, Scheme, and Self.
        
        Mocha was quickly renamed to JavaScript, and it was released as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in December 1995. The name “JavaScript” was chosen because of the popularity of Java at the time, and Netscape wanted to leverage that popularity to make its new language more successful.
        
        The Purpose of JavaScript
        The purpose of JavaScript was to make it easier for web developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. At the time, most web pages were static and did not have any interactive elements.
        
        JavaScript was designed to change that by allowing developers to create scripts that could interact with the user, modify the contents of the page, and even communicate with web servers.
        
        JavaScript was also designed to be a lightweight language that could run in web browsers without the need for any additional plugins or software. This made it a popular choice for web developers who wanted to create dynamic web pages without requiring users to download and install additional software.</P>
